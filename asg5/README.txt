The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize with the data mining concepts.

Consider a shopping database relational schema with one table as:
    
    Purchase( Customer, ItemBought )

The data for this table has been sent through email (to yourusername@fiu.edu).
If the email is not in your inbox, please check the spam folder.
The value on the first line of the data is the minimum support value.
Perform data mining manually on this given set of data values and output

    1) Frequent itemsets at ALL possible levels starting from L-1 that satisfy the specified 
       minimum support value
       
    2) For the frequent itemset L-2,
        - enumerate all possible association rules
        - compute the confidence value and interest value for each association rule

Note that support, confidence and interest are floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0
The minimum support value for asg5 data also follows this value range.

Customized data set for Asg5:
