The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize with the map-reduce paradigm.

Consider a shopping database relational schema with one table as:
    Purchase( City, ProductCategory, Price, PaymentMode )

A custom data set (as a CSV file) has been created for you. You need to write and test three python scripts
to process this sales data information (500,000 records) to answer three questions.

Your custom data set and questions specific to this data set can be accessed from
